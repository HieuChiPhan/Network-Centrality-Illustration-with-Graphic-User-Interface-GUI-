# Network Centrality Illustration Graphic User Interface (GUI) Version 1.0.0
This GUI developed to support for the observation on similarity between the betweeness centrality and the Algebraic Connectivity Centrality. The use of Algebraic Connectivity as an useful metric for Water Distribution Network has been develop by author and colleagues since 2017 with the following studies:
